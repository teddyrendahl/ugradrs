`ugradrs` is a tiny Autograd engine inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) implemented in Rust. Intended as a personal exploration 
of the mechanics of neural networks. The repository allows for the creation of a
DAG of scalar value operations with a small Pytorch-like API wrapper.
